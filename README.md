# Connect4
### Tom Andreae and Vin Leang - Highly Caffeinated


### Requirements:
- Java Version 17 or higher, edu.macalester.graphics library, VS code.

### How to Run:
- Clone repository and copy into VS code.

### Limitations:
- The token dropping animation happens on top of the board, rather than creating the illusions that it is inside the board.
- No AI implementation, can only do player versus player.

### Resources:
- Prior homeworks and in-class activities.

### Short Description of the project:
The project is making the classic Connect4 game on Java. It is the exact same as any typical Connect4 game, with this being a player versus player game.

### Why we chose this project:
It seemed doable and fun. It would be easy to show to prospective employers in the future. And it also has room for increased complexity if we choose to go beyond just the base version.

### Inspiration behind the project:
Actual Connect4.

### Rough implementation and responsibility plan (what needs to be accomplished, who will do what when):
The plan is to find assets or make the tokens and the grid. For coding, we’ll need to map out the grid and have the program recognize when a player has won. There should be a play again button and a score that is kept every time a player has won. We’ll share the responsibilities equally.
