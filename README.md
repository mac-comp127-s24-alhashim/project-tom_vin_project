## Introduction
This repository contains the classic Connect4 game implemented in Java. Developed by **Tom Andreae** and **Vin Leang**, this project replicates the classic tabletop game digitally.

## Requirements:
To run this game, you will need:
- **Java Version 17** or higher.
- **edu.macalester.graphics** library, for handling graphical components.
- **Visual Studio Code** or any Java-compatible IDE.

## Installation and Running the Game
Follow these steps to get the game running on your machine:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the cloned reposityory in Visual Studio Code.
3. Navigate to the `src/Connect4` directory.
4. Open `Connect4Game.java` and run the code via your IDE.

## How to Play
- The gameplay follows the traditional Connect4 rules where two players take turns dropping colored tokens into a seven-column, six-row grid.
- The first player to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of their own tokens wins.
- Players can stat a new game or exit after a game concludes.

## Limitations:
- The token animation does not create the illusion of falling inside the board.
- Depending on the computer you run it on, the token animation might seem slow.
- Restart doesn't show on the same canvas.
- Currently, the game supports only a player-versus-player mode without AI.

## Resources:
- This project builds upon knowledge acquired from previous homeworks and class activities from the Macalester College COMP 127 course.

## Short Description of the project:
The project is making the classic Connect4 game on Java. It is the exact same as any typical Connect4 game, with this being a player versus player game.

## Why we chose this project:
It seemed doable and fun. It would be easy to show to prospective employers in the future. And it also has room for increased complexity if we choose to go beyond just the base version.

## Inspiration behind the project:
Actual Connect4.

## Rough implementation and responsibility plan (what needs to be accomplished, who will do what when):
The plan is to find assets or make the tokens and the grid. For coding, we’ll need to map out the grid and have the program recognize when a player has won. There should be a restart, undo, and exit button. We’ll share the responsibilities equally.
