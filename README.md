# Connect 4

Name: Tom Andreae, Vin Leang
Team Name: High Caffeinated

Short Description of the project:
The project is making the Connect 4 on Java. The base version will have player vs player. If we have time, we will add more functionalities like changing the tokens to other shapes and pictures as well as possibly including a computer vs player version.

Why we chose this project:
It seemed doable and fun. It would be easy to show to prospective employers in the future. And it also has room for increased complexity if we choose to go beyond just the base version.

Inspiration behind the project:
Actual Connect 4

Rough implementation and responsibility plan (what needs to be accomplished, who will do what when):
The plan is to find assets or make the tokens and the grid. For coding, we’ll need to map out the grid and have the program recognize when a player has won. There should be a play again button and a score that is kept every time a player has won. We’ll share the responsibilities equally.
